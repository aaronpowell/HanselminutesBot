      <title>Building and Scaling  Geo-Distributed Cloud Apps with Denis Magda</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Denis started at Sun Microsystems and Oracle where he worked on JVM/JDK and led one of the Java development groups. After learning Java from the inside, he joined the world of distributed systems and databases, where he's remained ever since. He talks to Scott about how to build large horizontal cloud apps that are geo-distributed and truly global.  </p><p>Cloud availability zones and regions are not immune to outages. The zones go down regularly, and regions become unavailable during natural disasters or human-caused incidents. If an availability zone or a larger area goes down, so does your application…unless the application functions across multiple geographic locations. We'll discuss availability and reliability patterns used by architects whose apps managed to withstand major cloud outages. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Let's move beyond buzzwords and talk about observability and DevOps in large systems. Observability is the ability to measure the internal state of a system only by its outputs, but often those outputs are hundreds of log files spread across dozens of systems. The cloud has only made these large systems harder to understand and manage. Scott talks to New Relic's Tori Wieldt about the benefits of formalizing how you think about distributed systems and the tools available to make things easier.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Surface Pro X is thin, light, and is absolutely silent because it has no fans! It uses a power-sipping ARM processor rather than an Intel processor. Jeremy Sinclair schools Scott on why it's significant that Windows can run on ARM now. We'll also learn what this means for developers and tools like Visual Studio Code. Can this ARM machine also emulate x86 processors? Will your next laptop run ARM?</p>

      <title>Performance as a Feature with Jeremy Boyd</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Raygun promises to give a window into how users are really experiencing your software applications with diagnostics and error logging and more. What's really interesting however, is how they scaled to billions of events. In moving to .NET Core from Node they increased throughput by 2000 percent. How do you build systems that scale to these heights while still dealing with Moore's Law? How do you load test a system this big? What does it mean to &quot;monitor what matters&quot;? Is .NET Core ready for production? All this plus perf as a feature on this episode.</p>

What's really interesting however, is how they scaled to billions of events. In moving to .NET Core from Node they increased throughput by 2000 percent. How do you build systems that scale to these heights while still dealing with Moore's Law? How do you load test a system this big? What does it mean to &quot;monitor what matters&quot;? Is .NET Core ready for production? All this plus perf as a feature on this episode.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Physics-based animation is commonplace in animated feature films and even special effects for live-action movies. How does one model something as complex as cloth, how it drapes on the body, moves in the wind, and more?  Tuur Stuyck talks about the research happening in this space, including his own, as well as his new book on the topic!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We talked to Arlan Hamilton two years ago (almost to the day) as she was starting her Venture Fund for underrepresented founders. What's changed since then? Arlan Hamilton's Backstage Capital has invested more than $4M+ in over 80 companies led by underrepresented founders. How has she gone from Homeless to VC in just a few years? Arlan also recently started Project Cover to give micro-grants to driven creatives. Scott catches up with Arlan to hear about how she's continued to build her team and her fund and BUILD COOL STUFF. And also - what's the right way to eat string cheese?</p>

      <title>Creativity, Code, Community, and Connected Objects with Dawn C. Hayes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Scott talks with coder, tinkerer, and occasional adjunct professor Dawn C Hayes about the intersection of physical computing and creating coding. As we write code more, we have to ask ourselves &quot;but are we improving our world? The community? Our culture?&quot; The advent of wearables, augmented games, and networked objects has the potential to take computing out of the garage and into the collective consciousness. Dawn teaches Scott about how these objects can combine with new thinking around informal learning to engage not only new audiences but the next generation of creator.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Part 1 of this Two Part podcast, I visit the home of Chris Sells and we make up a topic for the show! I suggested we talk about what programming will look like in 15 years, and Chris countered with the suggestion that we chat about the LAST 15 years first, then the next 15. We have a blast when we chat, so this show went long, almost 50 minutes, so we cut it in half so as not to waste the listeners time. Be sure to check out Part Two!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We discuss &quot;Web 2.5&quot; as Silverlight (ne WPF/E) is announced. Seems that Rich Cross-Platform Runtimes quickly approach from both Microsoft and Adobe. What does this mean to the average developer? We also try to make up for some misinformation we spread in Show 46 on WPF/E, and while we do it, we probably speculate wildly and spread more.</p>
